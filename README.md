# discord-eclipse

This is a standard issue bot that I will be using to test my python skills as I learn.
The bot was created back in 2018 when I only knew spaghetti code from grade 9 so hopefully I can actually get it to do something.

This is also my first experience with actually using GitHub so good lord this is gonna be interesting.
